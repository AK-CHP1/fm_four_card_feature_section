## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this challenge I learnt about CSS grid and advanced floating concepts like `display: flow-root` which a container to completely contain the floating element.

### Continued development

This project still needs to fix box shadows for the feature cards

### Useful resources

- [MDN article on floats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats) - This article taught me about `display: flow-root` which helps the container of a floating element to completely wrap it so that the element following the container doesn't start wrapping itself around the floating element
